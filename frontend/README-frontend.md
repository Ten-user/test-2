# Frontend (React)

## Setup
1. In `frontend` create a `.env` file if you want to set the API base:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
The app will run on port 3000 by default.

The frontend uses Bootstrap via CDN for a professional look.
